## SIEMENS sequence names

This table contains a list of SIEMENS vendor sequences that I found in
various protocols, along with the general sequence type they correspond to.
The software versions listed are not exhaustive -- these are only those
for which I have _seen_ a protocol from that version with the corresponding
sequence.

From my understanding, `gre*` (GRE) sequences are not explicitely spoiled, while
`*fl*` (FLASH) sequences always have a spoiler gradient and have the option
to further apply RF spoiling.

The `spc*` (SPACE) sequences are SIEMENS-specific variants of `tse` (Turbo
Spin Echo) that use 3D spatial encoding, partial fourier and k-space zero
filling.
